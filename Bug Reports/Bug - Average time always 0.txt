-Steps to Reproduce-
1. Have the hash server running.
2. POST to the hash endpoint a few times, noting the total time it takes for the request to process(postman gives a breakdown for each step)
3. GET the stats page and view the average time

--Expected Results:
AverageTime is a number greater than 0

--Actual Results:
AverageTime is always 0, no matter how many requests have been sent
